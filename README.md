# CS-4632-Model-Simulation
### Project Overview:

The focus of this project will be the simulation and performance comparison of the self-checkout stations with the served cashier lanes in a retail setup. This simulation incorporates an analysis of relevant parameters such as the average waiting time of customers, average transaction time, average error rate, and average operational support to establish a more efficient system under the conditions introduced.

### Goals for Implementation:

Develop and use a discrete-event simulation (DES), which addresses customer comings and service functions in the self-checkout lane and lanes with a cashier.

Where appropriate, integrate simulation of real-world accounts for variances in customer arrival rates of transactions and the rate of errors.

Performance is assessed based on average wait time, queue length, and customer satisfaction with the system.

Generate an output that enables one to visualize and compare different designs of self-checkout stations and cashier lanes.

### Plan for Simulation:

**Input Variables:** Number of customers, the ratio of self-checkout stations to cashier lines, rates of customer arrivals, and rates of causing errors.

**Output Metrics:** Wait time averages, queue length, levels of customer satisfaction, and operational expenses.

**End State:** This is a complete simulation that incorporates different scenarios to enable adequate assessment of the efficiency of self-service for shoppers against standard checkout of shoppers.

### Extensions/Changes to Original Documentation:

The revision of the UML diagram explained reasons for the changes in the system structure more so why a population and activity state need to be accounted for to consider changing error rates and different patterns of customers.

The initial review has been enhanced by including some recent applications of self-checkout technology in retail settings.
